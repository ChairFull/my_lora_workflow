# Current LoRA workflow

Most of my public LoRA's are here: https://civitai.com/user/chairfull

## 1) Training Data

Image quality seems to be big part in how well they turn out, so I try to use the highest quality images I can find.

I don't crop them, except to remove text or other people.

Many images are over 2000x3000. Some >8000x5000.

### Finding images

#### (Optional) Chrome extensions
[Imagus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imagus/immpkjjlgappgfkkfieppnmlhakdmaab?hl=en): See full image by hovering it or a link, and hit `Ctrl+S` to save it.

[Double Click Image Downloader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/double-click-image-downlo/bkijmpolkanhdehnlnabfooghjdokakc/?hl=en): For quicker downloading.

[UBlockOrigin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en): Nicest adblocker, imo.

#### Sources
[Yandex](yandex.ru/images)
This is my goto. Better than Google images. Allows finding images in different size.  

1) Search your subject.
2) Sort images by largest: ![](/images/yandex_large.jpg)
3) Pic largest size: ![](/images/yandex_largest.jpg)
  Only do this if the largest is actually better. It may be an crummy upscale, or the link may not even work.

You can also search for better quality images by dragging them into Yandex, and it will do a `Similar image search`.

### Processing images

#### Dealing with duplicates
While looking for images I save as many as look decent. Sometimes coming across higher quality versions later. So I end up with duplicates.

To remove duplicates I use [Geeqie Image viewer](https://www.geeqie.org).
- Open Geeqie and go to your folder of images.
- Select all of them in the lower right panel.
- `Right Click` and select `Find duplicates`.
- Sort on `Similarity`, (low, med, high).
- If it finds any, get rid of whichever ones seem lower quality, by `Right Clicking` and selecting `Delete`.

### Zip
Zip the images: `zip ./my_pics -r .`

### Upload
- Upload the zip to your Google drive.
- `Right Click` it in GDrive, select `Share` or `Get link`.
- Toggle `Make Public`.

## 2) Kohya
I used: https://github.com/Linaqruf/kohya-trainer (Dreambooth method, top one.)

I use the Google colab version as my GPU sucks, but I assume it works the same if you downloaded.

I mostly BLIP to auto caption the images.  
Recently I started upping the word count from `15-75` to `30-100`, and the results have seemed a tinge better?

Leave pretty much all the settings values at their default, except:
  * For pre trained model download: `Stable-Diffusion-v1-5`.
  * For VAE model download: `stablediffusion.vae.pt`
  * Set `pretrained_model_name_or_path` to `/content/pretrained_model/Stable-Diffusion-v1-5.safetensors`
  * Set `vae` to `/content/vae/stablediffusion.vae.pt`
  * Set `class_token` to `man`.

# Experiments

## Higher quality through tokens
Tokens in the captions, with the exception of the `class_token` are what you **don't** want trained as part of your model:  
So for a man: `a man, in a red hat, in a forest` would only extract the `man` not the `red hat` or `forest`.  
Theoretically, this should work for style and image quality, so for old images I might add: `blurry, old image, scan, jpeg artifacts, low quality` in hopes the model will pull a sharper image.
